 K-FX (Kinect FX) Readme, Dominik Deak
---------------------------------------


1. Introduction

Kinect FX (K-FX) is simple project designed to tap into the Kinect hardware
through the libfreenect API and apply some funky post processing filters on the 
raw video stream. The post processing is done entirely on hardware through OpenGL
shaders. K-FX is based on the Qt SDK, a cross platform API. The project was 
successfuly built on Windows XP and MacOS. Linux was not tested.


2. Structure

The source code package is organised in the following way:

   assets/                 Contains shaders and textures

   windows/                Visual Studio 2010 project
   kfx.linux.pri           Linux project include for qmake
   kfx.macosx.pri          Mac OS X project include for qmake
   kfx.pro                 Main project file for qmake
